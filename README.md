# Giffy in a Jiffy 

[Demo](https://luxury-tanuki-a2b011.netlify.app/)

Find a gif in a flash!   
And yes, i do pronounce gif with a 'g'.  

I used React hooks like useState and useEffect to achieve my functionalities. I incorporated localStorage to save favorited gifs. I tried out a react library I found from Material UI to build my hamburger menu quickly. It is located on the top right and expands out from the right side to reveal favorited gifs. For clarity purposes, each gif is highlighted in yellow when its hovered on. It will be red if its a gif you favorited. I can see that the rubric requires ajax but i made one with axios as well, its commented out.
